  <p>Risotto is an Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy consistency.
    The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables.
    Many types of risotto contain butter, onion, white wine, and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.
    It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>6 cups low-sodium chicken stock, or vegetable stock</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 lb shiitake mushroom(455 g), stemmed and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups arborio rice(200 g)</li>
      <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese(110 g), plus more for serving</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="instructions">
      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Add the stock to a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Once the stock is boiling, reduce the heat to
        low or remove the pan from the heat and keep nearby.</li>
      <li>Heat the olive oil in a wide, tall pot over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the shallot and
        cook, stirring frequently, until translucent.</li>
      <li>Add the shiitake mushrooms and butter. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have cooked down and
        browned.</li>
      <li>Add the garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper, stir, and cook for 1 minute, until the garlic is fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add the rice and stir until fully coated in the mushroom mixture. Let the rice toast for 1-2 minutes, until
        aromatic.</li>
      <li>Add the white wine and cook until evaporated, stirring occasionally.</li>
      <li>Add 1 cup (240 ml) of the hot stock and stir to combine. Cook, stirring frequently, until the stock is fully
        absorbed by the rice.</li>
      <li>Continue to add the stock, ½ cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring continuously, until fully absorbed, 15-20 minutes.
        Depending on how fast the rice cooks, there may be leftover stock.</li>
      <li>Once the rice is al dente, remove from the heat. Add the Parmesan and stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Garnish the risotto with parsley, Parmesan, salt, and pepper.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
